		<h2>My Projects</h2>
		<article>
			<h4>1) Weather application</h4>
			<p>This was my main project during my first year. I developed a real-time working weather application which can be used to check the weather of any particular city or country. The application updates the information automatically when we search for a city, so there is no need to refresh the page.</p>

			<h4>2) Tic tac toe game</h4>
			<p>This also was one of my main projects during the first year. I developed a tic tac toe game in Python which implemented the use of functions, file handling and core Python programming concepts.This game allows two players to play against each other, keep track of scores and save the game results to a file.</p>
